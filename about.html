<h2>Who are we? Well, we are Northbound Events an online company that has lists of events that are taking place and have the great opportunity to have these tickets on put each event tickets on sale on our website with the same ticket prices that are sold on each event's individual website. This allows the customers to purchase on our website, and you do not have to worry about our links taking you to some other website where you can pay for the tickets on this website, and we will take care of the rest. We carry out monthly updates during the year as some events only announce event dates and times and put tickets on sale a few months before the event starts like events that take place towards the end of the year, and we perform these updates so that these events are on our website and you can purchase tickets on this website with no fuss. </h2>

<h2>If you have any concerns or any problems, please contact our member of staff via email and we will get in touch with you as soon as possible.  </h2>
